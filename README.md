# LinkCheckerWithAJAX Lab

This is a demo application.  The basic functionality is a site that allows the user to enter a url.  The site will make a get request on the url and save the http response code.

## Objectives

* Make all of the tests pass (both rails and jasmine)
* Make the app all work on a single page
* Creating the site in the DB and updating the new site once it is saved should be done with ajax and javascript
